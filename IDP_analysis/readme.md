Overview

This script automates the retrieval and analysis of intrinsically disordered region (IDR) predictions for a set of UniProt IDs using the IUPred2A web service. It extracts disorder scores for specific curated phosphorylation sites and generates a scatter plot visualizing the IDR scores.

Features

Fetches IUPred2A short disorder predictions for a list of UniProt IDs.

Extracts disorder scores for curated phosphorylation sites.

Saves the extracted IDR scores into a CSV file.

Generates a scatter plot of disorder scores.
